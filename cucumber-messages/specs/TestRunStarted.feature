Feature: Sending TestRunStarted messages

    Scenario Outline: Starting test suite sends a message (independent of feature file exist)

        Given there are '<NumberOfFeatureFiles>' feature files
        When the test suite is executed
        Then '<NumberOfTestRunStartedMessages>' TestRunStarted messages have been sent

        Examples:
          | Case                              | NumberOfFeatureFiles | NumberOfTestRunStartedMessages |
          | empty test suite                  | 0                    | 0                              |
          | test suite contains feature files | 1                    | 1                              |

    @SpecFlow
    Scenario: Parallel test runs can send multiple messages

        Given the test runner is 'SpecFlow+Runner'
        And there are '3' feature files
        And all steps are bound and pass
        When the test suite is executed with a testThreadCount of '3'
        Then '3' TestRunStarted messages have been sent

    Scenario: Test suite starting time is included in the message

        When the test suite is started at '2019-05-13 13:09:46'
        Then a TestRunStarted message has been sent with the following attributes
          | Attribute | Value               |
          | timestamp | 2019-05-13 13:09:46 |

    Scenario Outline: Cucumber implementation is included in message

        Given the cucumber implementation is <implementation>
        When the test suite is executed
        Then a TestRunStarted message has been sent with the following attributes
          | Attribute              | Value              |
          | cucumberImplementation | <ImplementationId> |

        @SpecFlow
        Examples:
          | implementation | ImplementationId |
          | SpecFlow       | SpecFlow         |
